I had the opportunity to interview with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) almost a year ago, and I wanted to share my experience for anyone who might find it helpful. Writing about it now also gives me a chance to reflect on the journey.

## Online Test üß†üíª

The process began with a 3-hour online test that covered a wide range of topics. The sections included aptitude, data structures & algorithms (DSA), software engineering, operating systems, computer networks, cloud computing, AI/ML, distributed systems, DevOps, databases, and both C and C++ programming.

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:

- **Aptitude (15 questions):** Sales graphs, pattern continuation, areas, probability, ratios, sequence matching, profits, basic math, graphs, and population-based questions.  
- **DSA and Software Engineering (5 questions):** Minimum cost, OOPs, time complexity, and stack.  
- **Operating Systems (3 questions):** Pages, process scheduling, and forking.  
- **Computer Networks (3 questions):** NAT configuration, HSRP, and ACL.  
- **Cloud Computing (3 questions):** Cloud infrastructure and situational questions.  
- **AI/ML (3 questions):** Randomness in LLMs, loss functions, and fine-tuning.  
- **Distributed Systems (3 questions):** Partitioning and replication.  
- **DevOps (2 questions):** Shell scripting and Git commands.  
- **Databases (3 questions):** Normal forms, closure, and candidate keys.  
- **C Programming (3 questions):** Memory allocation, and "guess the output."  
- **C++ Programming (3 questions):** Switch statements, memory allocation, and "guess the output."  

Finally, there were 2 coding questions:  
- **Easy:** Maximize a score by performing operations on an array. Select an element, add its value to the score, and replace it with the ceiling of one-third of its value. The goal was to get the highest score after k operations.  
- **Difficult:** Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) Cache.  

After the test, some of us were shortlisted for the interview rounds üéâ.

## The Interview Process üé§

There were 3 rounds: Technical 1, Technical 2 (Managerial), and the HR round.

### Round 1: Technical üíª

This round lasted about 45 minutes. It began with an introduction, followed by a binary search DSA question. I was also asked questions on operating systems and computer networks.

The discussion then moved to my projects, where I had to explain topics like Kafka, web development, and network protocols. I was asked about the 3-way handshake, semaphores, log replication, hashing, and how to handle key collisions (I had to write pseudocode).

One tricky part involved combining concepts from Kafka and operating systems. I had to explain my entire stack, including why I had chosen certain technologies.

The interviewers were very friendly. Looking back, my biggest takeaway was the importance of explaining the thought process‚Äîit helps the interviewer follow your logic and demonstrates depth of understanding.

### Round 2: Managerial (Technical) üñ•Ô∏è

This round lasted around 45‚Äì55 minutes. I was given two DSA questions based on matrix operations, along with a linked list problem and a follow-up question. These questions focused more on logic than on complex algorithms.

We also covered:  
- File management and storage in operating systems.  
- Computer networks (OSI layers, network connections).  
- Databases (SQL).  
- Cloud computing, where we discussed the pros and cons of public vs. private clouds and how data is securely stored (replication and logs).  

I also had to explain the tech stacks I had used in my projects, such as Next.js, MongoDB, AWS basics, RAFT Consensus, and API Routing.

### Round 3: HR Round (Non-Technical) üó£Ô∏è

This was a more casual discussion and lasted about 25 minutes. We talked about my leadership roles, club activities, hobbies, and family background. It was a friendly conversation, more about getting to know me as a person beyond the technical skills.

## My Preparation Advice üìö

- **Master the basics:** Be solid on OS, CN, and DSA. These came up frequently, and strong fundamentals were very helpful.  
- **Explain your thought process:** Always explain your approach to solving a problem. It shows your understanding and helps the interviewer follow your reasoning.  
- **DSA practice:** I mainly practiced on LeetCode. It‚Äôs not necessary to solve everything‚Äîfocus on major topics and follow a consistent pattern.  
- **Be honest:** Don‚Äôt bluff your way through your resume. Know every concept you mention. If you don‚Äôt know something, admit it.  
- **Stay calm:** Take your time. It‚Äôs okay to pause, think, or even ask clarifying questions.  
- **Know the company:** Research the role and the company in advance. Have a few thoughtful questions ready for the interviewer.  

## Conclusion üåü

Looking back, the HPE interview process was challenging but also a valuable learning experience. It pushed me to strengthen my fundamentals and gain confidence in explaining my projects and technical knowledge.  

If you are preparing for interviews, I hope this post gives you some clarity on what to expect. Good luck üçÄ, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!  

I‚Äôll also be linking a few of the resources I used for preparation‚Äîhopefully they‚Äôll help others too.
