# Sample Draft Blog Post

This is a sample draft blog post to help you understand the structure and format.

## Getting Started

When writing a new draft:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this `drafts` folder
2. Add the appropriate frontmatter (see above)
3. Write your content in markdown format
4. Keep `published: false` until ready to publish

## Moving to Production

When your draft is ready:

1. Change `published: false` to `published: true` 
2. Move the file from `drafts/` to `posts/`
3. Move any images from `drafts/images/` to `posts/images/`

## Content Guidelines

- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include relevant tags
- Add a clear description
- Ensure the date is in YYYY-MM-DD format

This draft will not appear on your website until it's moved to the `posts` folder and published is set to `true`.
